# Teacher's PET: Personalised Engagement Tracker
 Teacher's Pet was borne with the belief that a whole new realm of real-time classroom data can be harnessed to provide key strategic insights to improve the quality of education in classrooms.
 
 ## The Vision
The advance of computer vision and deep learning neural nets have enabled a new wave of data-empowered opportunities to unfold. By deploying convolutional neural networks to run real-time screening, this enables educators, be it teachers in school/professors in universities to be equipped with data-driven insights.
